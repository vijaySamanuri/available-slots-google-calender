# available-slots-google-calender
List out all the available slots on a specific day/week considering a group of people


The idea is simple, Let's say you want to organize an event in Google calender with a group of people but not sure on what time slot is convenient to entire group, considering everyone in the group having their own schedules.

This project aims to solve this problem, given a time slot duration as an input and the date/week, it just fetches you the list of all available slots which are non overlapping with any one's schedule and then allows you to schedule and block the time slot. Also aims to provide a way to do consensus on chosing the right convenient time slots and the time slot suggestions.
